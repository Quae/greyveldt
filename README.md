# Greyveldt Terms of Service
_Don't be a dick   - Wheaton's Law_

### Treat People Like People

By joining, you agree to treat your fellow players with civility even amidst disagreement. For example, you will be polite when pointing out rules/lore/gameplay violations to other players, and likewise, you will respond courteously when/if such is done for you. This doesn't mean your characters can't be jerks-- but you, yourself, must be civil and polite.

### Adherence to OOC & IC
By joining, you agree to abide by OOC vs. IC distinction by using specific OOC channels or ((text)) for in-channel clarifications. Please minimize OOC banter in IC channels.

### Be Cooperative
By joining, you are agreeing to participate in the created world as an equal partner for improversational play and to abide by existing lore as best as you are able. There can be exceptions to the lore, but keep in mind that exceptions are just that- and if everyone is an exception, they are no longer exceptional. Please root exceptions in good storywriting (i.e. humans normally have human coloured eyes by Earth standards, but this one has glowy blue eyes because they're addicted to Crystal).

### Keep 18+ Content Off Public Channels
By joining, you agree to keep overly gorey/violent, sexual or otherwise 18+ content in private channels. If a content is requested to be moved to a private channel, please be courteous and do so without complaint. By participating in 18+ content, you are confirming that you are 18+ and abiding by the laws of your region. Greyveldt is not responsible for monitoring or mediating private in-character content. Private OOC bullshit may result in a ban.

### Copyright Stuff
By joining, you acknowledge that your original character alone is yours; lore belongs to Greyveldt and characters belong to their owners. Writings, art, etc, is copyright the creators; express permission must be granted to use someone else's, or Greyveldt's, content in capacities other than related to this server.

### We follow the 'Yes-And' Style of Improv RP
Instead of telling someone 'you can't do that because of x', we prefer to say, 'x is the status quo, what's different here- in vague terms- that lets you break it to make a good story?' The caveat being that we're assuming everyone is coming from a point of artistic license rather than metagaming or Mary-sue-itis. This does NOT give people the right to god-mode your character. Please ask people beforehand if you have an intended outcome in mind during cooperative play. 'Creativity and cool story telling first, super in-depth attention to detail on the meta-physics of blood-ritual and how you just violated all of them, second'.

### There's a GM. Her name is Quae.
By joining, acknowledge that this server is owned by Quae and Quae has final say in rule enforcement, argument resolution and banning decisionmaking. She'd like to be viewed as a generally-off-hands game master figure rather than the boss,so figure your shit out amongst yourselves before taking it to her because she won't be happy about playing mediator.
