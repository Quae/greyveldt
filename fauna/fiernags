#Fiernags
##<b>Primary Habitat:</b> Lucid Wastes
##<b>Physical attributes:</b> Lichy chimera creatures: skeletal firebreathing carnivorous bearded unicorns with forked tongues, stinging tails, and cloven hooves.
##<b>Culture:</b> These are highly intelligent, calculating social beasts communicate with both a spoken and nonverbal language thusfar incomprehensible to all linguists who've attempted to make sense of it. The language is referred to as "nagspeech", and consists mostly of layered, harmonic rasping, hissing and keening howls.
<i>These failed products of an early colonial civilization's attempts to bioengineer and domesticate one of Greyveldt's prodigious indigineous species.</i>
Now and then, Neoferkin kids try to tame/ride 'em. 
Now and then, at least a few times, Felemeltes took a stab at 'enlightening' these beasts with Felemelte crystals, but it didn't make them anthro...it just made them mad.

Probably there's some kind of daft redneck Neoferkin rodeo that involves taming attempts. So that's leisurely...
