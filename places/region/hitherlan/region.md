# Hitherlan
## A northerly peninsular nation, isolated from its neighbors by thickets of briar roses and stinging nettles, and a prehistoric bog where prehistory is rumoured to remain quite active.

### Topography
To the south, between the capitol and border-region bog, the terrain slopes into barren storm-embattled steppe inhabited by rural farmers. Approximately central to the the lowlands, a large mirror-surfaced lake nourishes fauna in the steppe's vast circumference. -The serfs there used to watch junk television and twiddle with smartphones before these things were banned.- Now the Olds among them make fun for themselves with internecine gladitorial disputes while 25% of the smarter kids try to learn science via free public college.
The other 75% of smart kids went into illegal promotion of black market ticket sales to pleb-sponsored battle royale events. Anthropomorphic creatures maintain the accessibility of infrastructure and perform a lot of noble work in society since the government afforded them personhood and opposable thumbs. Communication barriers still prove an issue.

#### Fiorraga Mountains

#### Auldeglace


#### Cities & Settlements
Pocket settlements, sparsely-populated by an ancient alpine race (Fiorraga Auldres), are peppered throughout the crystalline mountains. These native people, ascetic monks mostly, adapted to the turbulent climate over millennia, and communicate extensively by way of avian heraldry - which caught on widely throughout the kingdom at large and, in light of a nationwide Internet ban, is Hitherlan's preferred means of correspondence. 

##### Yfeldes
The selectively low-tech hub of national activity encircling this northerly nook is known abroad as the city of Yfeldes. Occupants of the city enjoy 5 hour workdays, robust libraries, public education in the occult arts and free mystic military training during the mandatory conscription years of their youth. Vegetarian falconry is a national pastime, practiced by hermits and aristocrats alike.

###### The Imperial Palace
Deep within the Fiorraga mountains, a great obsidian palace looms large and inpregnable between formidable stone monoliths and sparkling quartz cliffs, burbled angrily upon by violent arctic seafoam. The imperial palace, a hybrid of art-deco, Gigeresque, and neo-gothic architecture, seems at once to claw at the earth and to grasp at the stars, the latter impression underscored by its proximity to the currently active volcano, Auldeglace. Auldeglace regularly pumps out nebulas of vulcan haze that hang low in the sky and block out the sun for much of the day.

### Inhabitants

### Social Structure
#### The Asatru : Priests of the Undying
The Asatru are both the keepers of the Auldeglace Tomb and the crusader army of God Empress Astryd. On a mundane level, they are an army of Hitherlani orphans and unwanted children trained for battle from a very young age, often from toddlerhood. Until the Return, they will remain stewards of the land and defenders of the tomb, but legend has it that a time will come when God Empress Astryd will rise again and the asatru will conquer the nations Hitherlan once possessed, the conquest for the glory of Astryd and the blood of the fallen in sacrament to the Unseelie Court.

#### The Proletariat
A bunch of mostly pretty inbred farmers who believe in magic, in the sense that they live in terror of the whims of their capricious god and lascivious birdfolk. (As discussed, the birdfolk aren't really terribly lascivious at all...) More on them later.
Anthropomorphic creatures (Felemeltes) live among them, recognized as equal citizens. The common faith of the proletariat is animistic, similar to druid traditions. There is little diversity in that respect and anyone who doesn't recognize the sovereignty of sentient creatures is culturally reproached and shunned - such barbarism is not to be tolerated. For this reason, members of Hitherlan society tend to be insular. Their dogmas and values are firmly entrenched and they see much of the rest of civilization as rather backward. Ironically, much of the rest of the world has a similar view of the Hitherlan people, but this is little concern of theirs.

### Lore
It is said by some that Hitherlan was formed in a yestermillennia when the region's indigenous tribes were mythically conquered by a great evil that since vanished into obscurity. It is said by some that the legends of the mountain folk hold the forgotten secrets of the Old World. It is said by others that "they themselves forgot and made up a bunch of myths to patch in the gaps. Oh, oral history, you quaint doddering thing you."

Hitherlan's most prominent mythic heroes include the God-Empress Astryd, her Unseelie Court and First of the Reagent, Changeling Jione (pronounced "Johnny").

The nation's current leader, Lord Reagent Smar, is one of a long line of reagents ascended since the territory was conquered in the ol' B.C.E. days. The reagents fill the archetypal role once purportedly played by Changeling Jione, a faithful servant of the sun-blighting God-Empress Astryd. Changelings are ritually integrated into Hitherlan politics when the imperial Unseelie Court cyclically sends an immortal emissary in the form of an unseelie child to walk among mortals, replacing a Felemelte/human child with one of their own. This unique form of embassy results in exquisite intel into the surrounding southerly populations and a freshening up of the council's bloodline as the reagant takes an Unseelie mate in betrothal. The Hitherlan population, a mixture of humans and forest creatures recognized equally as sharing inalienable rights of citizenship, remain conventionally mortal and earthly and are left to intermarry amongst themselves.

In the modern era, this happens to represent a relatively small (human) gene pool, and thus the population of local humans are deemed unkindly but not altogether inaccurately to be a bit imbred. Hitherlan history, for what it's worth, holds it that this was not always the case.

#### Asatru & the Unseelies
The Unseelies are shadowfolk of the Nether: valkyries/dark spirits who await at the place between life and oblivion, feasting on the aura of spilled blood and souls.

Please recall how conservation of mass applies also to "one's allotted time in life"... One get only so much, and the FA can see that quantity. But what happens when that time gets cut short by premature death, due to murder - even accidental? Then this extra Vitality 'mass' (the concentrated portion of your soul that was still attached to your mortal form) has to go somewhere, it hasn't been used up, so it sits in the Nether - the world between the living and the dead - to continue its slow disentigration/titration into the Land of the Dead without the benefit of a fleshly prison/tool to house it. This is how we get ghosts: they are souls slowly disintegrating into Death due to having some alotted Lifeforce left unused, due to being murdered. They can't move on until that Vitality is spent, those extra years they 'should have been alive' but for intervention by another sovereign entity.
While this lifeforce (a person's ghost) remains between worlds (in the Nether), it's fair game to the Unseelie, apex predators of the Nether. Sometime ago, early Hitherlan mystics must have communed with the spirits - ghosts or the predators themselves - and established a symbiosis with these otherworldly creatures. An Unseelie can inhabit the body of a willing host, temporarily. The feeling of having one's body occupied by such an entity is a feeling of supernatural power, the perception of invincibility. For this time, a mortal is not immune to harm by a long shot, but doesn't feel pain, or fatigue - instead, they become compelled by the spirit's own bloodlust, the desire to feed their visiting entity. Once, it is said, this led to the Asatru conquering half the world.

This is not without its price. Once a spirit has had its fill, it departs from the mortal host - sated with its dinner of ghosts and seeking the freedom of disembodied life. At this point, the mortal - perhaps moreso than ever - must finally reconfront his or her mortality: perceive the pain long suppressed, tend the wounds left unheeded, surrender to frailty and fatigue. The desperation of mortal brittleness often drives the possessed to seek more possession and longer, increasingly struggling to lure hungry spirits to possess him/her for to be fed. These sorts, lacking self-control, often are their own undoing - in their pursuit of oblivion to weakness, they become careless and jeopardize their own survival. When their victims fight back, they can't feel the dying person's devastating counterattacks until the spirit eventually leaves them - a heap of ruined flesh dying on the earth. And the spirit then camps beside this body, eager to greet its former mortal slave in the Nether. Eager to be fed one last time.
