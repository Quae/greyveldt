# Hitherlan
## Hitherlan is a northerly peninsular nation, isolated from its neighbors by thickets of briar roses and stinging nettles, and a prehistoric bog where prehistory is rumoured to remain quite active.

Deep within the Fiorraga mountains, a great obsidian palace looms large and inpregnable between formidable stone monoliths and sparkling quartz cliffs, burbled angrily upon by violent arctic seafoam. The imperial palace, a hybrid of art-deco, Gigeresque, and neo-gothic architecture, seems at once to claw at the earth and to grasp at the stars, the latter impression underscored by its proximity to the currently active volcano, Auldeglace. Auldeglace regularly pumps out nebulas of vulcan haze that hang low in the sky and block out the sun for much of the day.

The selectively low-tech hub of national activity encircling this northerly nook is known abroad as the city of Yfeldes. Occupants of the city enjoy 5 hour workdays, robust libraries, public education in the occult arts and free mystic military training during the mandatory conscription years of their youth. Vegetarian falconry is a national pastime, practiced by hermits and aristocrats alike.

Pocket settlements, sparsely-populated by an ancient alpine race (Fiorraga Auldres), are peppered throughout the crystalline mountains. These native people, ascetic monks mostly, adapted to the turbulent climate over millennia, and communicate extensively by way of avian heraldry - which caught on widely throughout the kingdom at large and, in light of a nationwide Internet ban, is Hitherlan's preferred means of correspondence. 

These hermits, the solemn ornithologists of Hitherlani culture, maintain a sacred bond between the winged emissaries of the Thereafter and this delicate mortal coil. Their practices are as timeless as the mountain corridors they inhabit.
