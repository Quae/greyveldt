# The Lucid Wastes
## Large swathes of petrified corruption mottle the land, rife with monsters and sickness.

### Topography
The safest way to cross the Lucid Wastes is via train; it's suspected that the noise of the steam engines themselves keep the dangerous population at bay. 'Safest' is relative, however, with robberies, swarms and unnatural disaster forever looming.

#### Geysers
Nightfall brings on a dangerous desert chill, and those not accustomed are advised to seek out one of the multitude of underground geysers that superheat the cystalline sands.

#### Mechanical Graveyard
Much can be gained in scavanging the wastes; pockets of untouched wreckage and technology from centuries bygone sell for a pretty price.

#### Cities & Settlements
##### [Roxane](roxane.md)
There is only one permanent settlement established in the Lucid Wastes, built upon an island of habitability surrounded by the dangerous Wastes.


### Inhabitants

#### Neoferkin

#### Sciame

#### Fauna
The creatures that live in the Lucid Wastes are as dangerous as the Wastes themselves. Those who do not fall prey to the enlightened Sciame are like to succumb to the strange unpredictability of the weird creatures that live there, such as Aeonfiernags and Eitil Sidhe.
