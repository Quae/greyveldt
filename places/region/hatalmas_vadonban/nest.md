### City in a Bowl
The city of Nest has been carved from mud, stone, and clay, dug into the very walls formed by the very same meteor that struck the world centuries ago, dooming uncounted thousands of lives and creating an age of chaos and unrest. A lasting monument to that calamitous event, the Crystal Spire stands in the centre of the crater, reaching up higher even than the rim, a natural edifice of gently-glowing geometry with its myriad irregular protrusions, jagged edges, and multitudinous facets. Against the night, it bathes its surroundings in that same preternatural, pale blue aura. A boon for those dispositioned to the night life and the bane of the photophobic who struggle to find sleep bathed in its luminescense.

Foresight and careful planning have seen the crater divided into tiers, relatively equal in height, where the land permitted, though circumstances where individuals were granted leeway to experiment with their own designs have created such features as tunnels, bridged gaps, balconies, and irregularly-sized structures to name a few. The tiers are connected typically by interspersed stairways and ramps, some exterior but most dug into the wall in the name of conserving usable surface space. Ladders are a common sight on the lower levels where the earliest excavations were done and fewer stairways exist. The bottom levels of the city, lost to flooding over the centuries, rest submerged, but continue to see use by aquatic Felemelte who have retained the ability to breathe underwater.

Beyond the rim of the crater, the city has continued to expand as its population has risen with the passing of generations. Individual homes, farmsteads, businesses, and other structures extend on all sides to the ever-receeding border of the surrounding woodlands.

#### Work Opportunities in Nest
Felemelte do not employ a financial model of their own, instead bartering on a national level. At the community level, individuals are assessed by their personal circumstances and needs, then provided an itemized voucher allocating them resources for food, luxuries, and soforth, conditional that they contribute to the wellbeing of the community at some level. The amount of contribution required varies by job (hours that must be worked, quotas, etc.) and, in some circumstances, the ability of the individual. The needs of the young, elderly, and infirm are added to the vouchers of their caretaker(s) and factored into the calculations of their required contributions. Additional allocations can be obtained through the performance of additional labour.

##### Peacekeeper
The town watch and a regular sight on the pathways of Nest. Postings within the crater are stationary, while patrolling is done in the expansions beyond the rim. Stationary postings are distributed so that each peacekeeper is in relatively close range of their neighbouring officers on both sides and alternated with the positions above and below them, maximizing the ability for officers to identify and react to situations where one of their comrades may require backup. As a result, particularly unruely individuals can find themselves swarmed within moments.
Duties of the Peacekeepers primarily consist of on location conflict mediation, crime prevention, and fight disruption. They typically operate individually, though may be assigned in pairs or larger numbers to guard figures of import or in high disturbance areas. Visitors are known to consult them for directions, although they are not formally trained for this and their ability to assist in such situations comes down to individual knowledge. It is generally understood amongst the citizenry that, aside from passing greetings, it is improper to distract a Peacekeeper on duty with conversation. For the Peacekeeper, the unfortunate result is that quiet postings quickly become tedious and are either foisted upon officers with low seniority. Those who volunteer for these posts quickly earn a reputation for being lazy and unambitious, deserved or not.
Typical Peacekeeper armament consists of a metal spearhead on a wooden shaft, a wooden round shield with or without metal reinforcement, and leather attire reinforced with wood or, in rare cases (see also: senior officers), metal. In addition, officers on duty carry a small wooden club for incapacitating uncooperative and violent persons. Individuals trained in archery may substitute a wooden bow and metal-tipped arrows, provided they can demonstrate sufficient skill to alleviate concerns of civilian injury. Peacekeepers are instructed in using deadly force as an absolute last resort.

The Peacekeeper organization as a whole enjoys a largely-untarnished reputation, with individual officers bearing the brunt of their own faults and misdeeds. They are widely trusted, respected, and regarded as essential to the city's peace and prosperity. A common sight is for civilians to bring them refreshments during guard duty, water on summer days and hot food or beverages in the cold and rainy seasons. Children are particularly encouraged to perform this service.

##### Warden
Collectively, the individuals responsible for the sanitation and beautification of the city. Their duties range from street sweeping to collecting and disposing of refuse to tending the innumerable planters found throughout Nest. They also attend to the raincatchers found along the rim and distribute water to homes and businesses, primarily for the mid-to-upper levels, as residences in proximity to the basin lake are responsible for themselves. Wardens generally share in all these duties, performing one at a time on a rotating schedule, though individuals who excel in a particular role may petition to a permanent assignment, availability permitting.
While this profession is not strictly looked down upon, it is the one most likely to be taken for granted or to be critizied for perceived failings in performance. Waste collection duty is particularly unglamourous, owing both to the obligatory handling of offal and the swiftness with which the general public grows irate when their odorous containers are not cleared in what is deemed a timely manner.

##### Custodian
They lucky few who are priviledged with the responsibilities of feeding, grooming, and exercising the animals that have been brought into Nest to receive exposure to the Crystal Spire and join the lifted. Next to shamans, they are the most revered of Felemelte society, at the cost of their being under almost constant, intense scrutiny. A Custodian who is seen to treat their charges poorly or be negligent in their duty can quickly find his or herself stripped of their position and ostracized from the community and even banished to the Lucid Wastes in extreme circumstances. They are held accountable for any injury or illness that befalls the ferals in their care, despite how commonly these are pre-existing conditions that have gone unnoticed or are beyond reasonable expectation for any individual to prevent. While they may be officially exonerated by review in such cases, public resentment frequently lingers.

##### Sculptor
Despite being centered around mundane and repetitive chisel and hammer work, they rank amongst the most prestigious in Nest. These are the crystal harvesters, a profession that in any other community would carry no weight, clout, or significance at all, but in this city means the beings who are permitted to trim the Crystal Spire itself. It may more accurately be refered to as crystal bonsai, as the cutting of the Spire is strictly regulated and monitored by the shamanic body. An overzealous harvester would quickly find him or herself relocated to an outlying mining or harvesting community where there enthusiasm for breaking of pieces of this sacred material would be less upsetting. This is a fairly rare occurance, however, as most Felemelte are conditioned to treat the Spire with such reverence that they require almost constant reassurances to be able to administer the necessary force to chip into it.
Sculptors who demonstrate skill at their task and have sufficient years of experience under their belts may find themselves offered overseer positions in those same outlying mining and harvesting communities, where they would discover too late that such lofty positions do not afford them the same respect and admiration that they received at the bottom of the pecking order in their role in Nest.

It is widely believed that Sculptors possess a closer bond with the Crystal Spire, either innately, making their selection for the role preordained, or built up over time through interaction and the guidance of the shamans who oversee them. This is pure superstition backed by unsubstantiated anecdotal evidence, but few have the audacity to openly express their disbelief.

##### Hands
"And all the rest." A term used to refer to those who fill the myriad other labour-intensive jobs in Nest, such as farmhands, stablehands, lifters and loaders, bussing tables, and so on. Though their work is no less essential to the city's way of life, they are seldom praised or thanked for their contributions.
