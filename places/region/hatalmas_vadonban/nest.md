### Workplace Opportunities in Nest
#### Peacekeeper
The town watch; stationary posts without patrols, provide on location conflict mediation, disrupt fights, make arrests, escort aggrieved parties to shamans for resolution of serious allegations, armed but trained to kill as last resort

#### Warden
All-in-one garbagemen janitors gardeners, collect refuse from homes for disposal, clean public spaces, tend planters, collect and distribute water (primarily for the upper levels, residences in proximity to the basin lake are responsible for themselves)

#### Custodian 
Feral caretakers; responsible for feeding, grooming, cleaning, exercise

#### Sculptor
Crystal harvesters, fairly mundane chisel + hammer work but taken -extremely- seriously in Nest due to the cultural significance of the Crystal Spire, also highly prestigious and much-sought vocation for the labour class

#### Hands
Shorthand for the various manual labour jobs ie stablehand, farmhand, etc.
