# Húst Enni
## Trade Hub and Carnivore Sanctuary

Spanning both sides of the eastward-flowing Drava River, Húst Enni is a modest community of mostly log cabins and wooden piers, encircled by Hatalmas Vadonban's signature dense forests. Due to the volume of boat traffic along the Drava, no bridges have been made to span it, and for lack of a nearby land crossing travel between the north and south banks is primarily done by canoe or rowboat. Throughout the day the river is littered with watercraft of all sizes, with larger vessels carrying goods down from Sznet Föld in the distant west or Nest in the east while a near-constant stream of smaller craft ferry beings from one side of the city to the other.

The north shore is primarily dominated by the large warehousing facilities as well as the offices for those who oversee the distribution of the staggering volumes of goods arriving and departing from the town. In addition, the railway station straddles the forest's edge along the community's northeastern border, providing Hatalmas Vadonban's busiest link to the neighbouring regions. Activity on this side of the city swells and dips around the arrival and departure of the train.

The south shore is where most of the residences lie, a modest assembly of primarily wooden construction, single level and typically single room with outhouses attached to the exterior. The homes nearest the riverbank typically front towards it, while those situated further back are aligned towards a central area where daily business and community gatherings are performed. The leading shaman's longhouse stands out amongst these as the largest of the buildings, though it stands no taller than the rest, and barring its size bears no outward uniqueness in design to indicate its significance as the spiritual centre for the Felemelte of the town.
