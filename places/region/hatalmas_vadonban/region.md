### Social Structure
#### Shamans
Felemelte shamans fulfil a diverse set of roles within Felemelte communities. Their primary function is as spiritual leaders, guiding the masses and teaching doctrine and customs via sermons and ceremonies. They are upheld as pillars of society and revered for their stronger-than-average bond with crystals and the forces of nature. As such, the office of a shaman is typically beyond reproach and, lacking sufficient indicators of popular resentment or distrust, will not be investigated for purported misdeeds. Typically, if a complaint or abuse is reported by a citizen for review, the shamanic order will simply release a statement of exoneration without performing any of the groundwork necessary to examine the incident.

Shamans are obviously not infallible, vulnerable to all the same temptations and flaws of character that exist in any sentient mind. Additionally, the only requirement for the title is to demonstrate a manifestation of any of the powers seen as essential to the role; the ability to sense the presence of subterranean crystals deposits, accurate weather forecasting, or a greater-than-average talent for nature-based magics. Once a prospective candidate has been identified, they are given nominal training and materials for further unstructured study and are sent to fill any vacancies in outlying Felemelte communities or assigned to understudy positions supporting other, established shamans. This results in shamans who are insufficiently versed in doctrine or vetted for purity of character or leadership ability being thrust into positions of authority and isolated from support from the shamanic body, meanwhile new shamans who remain in Nest receive more tutelage and serve in a subordinate capacity for years, if not the entirety of their services, ensuring that the capital of Felemelte culture remains better served in spiritual regards than outlying settlements.


### Lore
Sciame came first. This much can be gathered by anyone perceptive enough to realize that the amount of crystal exposure necessary to lift a creature from feral to anthro is relative to the size of their body, however the Felemelte do not officially recognize this fact, preferring the narrative that theirs was the first and therefore somehow "most pure" interpretation of the crystal's blessing, taking full advantage of the short memories of the insectoids and humans to maintain their interpretation of history. Those within the Felemelte populace who make this realization on their own are "gently encouraged" to reassess their position under threat of ostracization by the shamanist body.

This narrative only arose, however, after popular consensus on the Sciame and their ways soured. In the early days of their existence the Felemelte happily attended to the lifting of insect kind with the same fervor they now limit to the animal kingdom. This part of their history is celebrated and used to paint the Sciame as a cautionary tale of what befalls those who do not adhere to the tenets of Felemelte spirituality.

### Arcana
#### Felemelte Magic
Owed to their close bond with crystals, all Felemelte are possessed with a degree of innate magical talent. Like any skill it must be learned through instruction, practice, or experimentation, but the potential to utilize these abilities is universal to them.

Conjure fire, a small flame that can be produced either in the palm of the hand or at the fingertip, cannot be discharged like a fireball, can be suppressed by sufficient water, wind, earth

Temporarily increasing or decreasing the amount of illumination produced by a crystal shard via touch, including the patches that have grown on their own bodies if they have that trait (eyeglow cannot be adjusted in this fashion)

Conjure water, essentially pulling moisture from the air, only small amounts at a time, enough to fill a glass with a bit of concentration, in a pinch, reduced-to-no effectiveness in dry places, may only produce ice pellets in sufficient cold

Conjure wind, and by wind I mean it's only slightly less impractical than fanning yourself with a hat

Plantmancy, make plants move, -not grow-, move, low-hanging tree branches in your path? give 'em a little extra lift while you pass under, make that stubborn weed uproot itself, get that fruit to wiggle itself off its stem and out of the tree (or bend the stem until it breaks if you're That kind of person)
