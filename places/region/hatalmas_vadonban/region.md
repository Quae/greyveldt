# Hatalmas Vadonban
## A territory spanning the majority of the north-eastern continent.

### Topography and Climate
"The Great Wilderness," as it was historically known, refers to a vast expanse of land stretching from the north and north eastern shores of __INSERT CONTINENT NAME HERE__ as far south as __INSERT LAKE NAME HERE__, and to the __INSERT MOUNTAIN RANGE HERE__ in the west which divides it from __INSERT NAME FOR LANDS SURROUNDING BEACON HERE__. It is predominantly a rugged and densely-forested region criss-crossed by rivers, dotted with freshwater lakes of middling size, and a patchwork of marshes and wetlands. In addition to the multitudinous pockets of crystal ore that are fervently sought by its native inhabitants, the area is wildly speculated to possess a wealth of untapped natural resources. The woodlands alone are estimated to be capable of supporting a logging industry that would provide Beacon with enough charcoal to fuel its steam engines for millenia to come.

The region experiences the full range of seasons annually, with temperatures reaching as high as forty-five degrees centigrade (one hundred and thirteen degrees farenheit) during the summer and falling to extreme lows, sometimes exceeding negative forty degrees centigrade (same, farenheit) during the winter. Precipitation regularly occurs as light-to-heavy rainfall during the warmer months, with moderate-to-heavy snowfall in the winter, diminishing to light snowfall or sleet in the southern extremities, while corrosive precipitation from the Lucid Wastes is either buffered by the __INSERT MOUNTAIN RANGE AGAIN HERE__ or falls upon the northern ocean. Severe thunder and wind storms, as well as hail, are less frequent but typically occur at least twice anually. Severe ice storms also impact the region at a regularity of one per five years. Flooding is common in the many basins and lowlands throughout the territory.

There is very little techtonic activity in the area and landquakes are virtually unheard of, typically failing to reach the intensity necessary to be recognized as such by laymen. Decades regularly pass between one occurance of a brief, inexplicable trembling and the next.

#### Cities & Settlements
##### [Nest](nest.md)
The cultural and spiritual capital of the Felemelte race, a stone and clay city dug from the walls of an ancient impact crater, bathed in the mystical light of the crystal spire that towers up from its centre. An estimated 3,000 lifted beings reside within the crater and its surrounding developments.

##### __Húst Enni__
A community populated exclusively by carnivorous and omnivorous species. It is a refuge for Felemelte who desire to both maintain their meat-centric diets and seek to escape the constant social pressure to adopt vegitarian or vegan lifestyles. Known residents are often subjected to particular scrutiny and distrust when visiting other settlements.

##### __Szent Föld__
The largest mining and crystal harvesting operation in Hatalmas Vadonban, as well as the settlement that has grown around it, located in the highlands beneath __INSERT MOUNTAIN RANGE AGAIN HERE__. In addition to a significant crystal deposit, the mines represent the bulk of iron and tin excavation in the region. The nearby tributary supplies the community with water, as well as providing a shipping lane for the wealth of materials clawed out from under the mountains. Its foundaries and smithies also constitute a significant majority of the Felemelte's industrial power.

### Social Structure
#### Shamans
Felemelte shamans fulfil a diverse set of roles within their communities, however even the lowest ranking within the shamanic body stands in the upper echelons of Felemelte society at large. Their primary function is as spiritual leaders, guiding the masses and teaching doctrine and customs via sermons and ceremonies. They are upheld as pillars of society and revered for their stronger-than-average bond with crystals and the forces of nature. As such, the office of a shaman is typically beyond reproach and, lacking sufficient indicators of popular resentment or distrust, will not be investigated for purported misdeeds. Typically, if a complaint or abuse is reported by a citizen for review, the shamanic order will simply release a statement of exoneration without performing any of the groundwork necessary to examine the incident.

Shamans are obviously not infallible, vulnerable to all the same temptations and flaws of character that exist in any sentient mind. Additionally, the only requirement for the title is to demonstrate a manifestation of any of the powers seen as essential to the role; the ability to sense the presence of subterranean crystals deposits, accurate weather forecasting, or a greater-than-average talent for nature-based magics. Once a prospective candidate has been identified, they are given nominal training and materials for further unstructured study and are sent to fill any vacancies in outlying Felemelte communities or assigned to understudy positions supporting other, established shamans. This results in shamans who are insufficiently versed in doctrine or vetted for purity of character or leadership ability being thrust into positions of authority and isolated from support from the shamanic body, meanwhile new shamans who remain in Nest receive more tutelage and serve in a subordinate capacity for years, if not the entirety of their services, ensuring that the capital of Felemelte culture remains better served in spiritual regards than outlying settlements.

The second most venerated role of a shaman is to oversee the uplifting of domesticated and undomesticated wildlife. While the day-to-day care of feral creatures is entrusted to trained labourers, specially-appointed shaman make daily visits to the stables and pens where these Felemelte-to-be are accomodated in Nest, tasked with monitoring and assessing their progress towards joining the lifted. They are responsible for discerning when heightened intelligence has emerged prior to physical alteration or the development of verbal communication skills, as well as to help ease and comfort these creatures for the remaining stages of their transition. Others are trained to specialize in the health and medical needs of the unlifted, ensuring that deficiencies in diet and exercise are addressed and that illness and injury is properly treated within the Felemelte's admittedly patchwork understanding of the veterinary sciences.


### Lore
Sciame came first. This much can be gathered by anyone perceptive enough to realize that the amount of crystal exposure necessary to lift a creature from feral to anthro is relative to the size of their body, however the Felemelte do not officially recognize this fact, preferring the narrative that theirs was the first and therefore somehow "most pure" interpretation of the crystal's blessing, taking full advantage of the short memories of the insectoids and humans to maintain their interpretation of history. Those within the Felemelte populace who make this realization on their own are "gently encouraged" to reassess their position under threat of ostracization by the shamanist body.

This narrative only arose, however, after popular consensus on the Sciame and their ways soured. In the early days of their existence the Felemelte happily attended to the lifting of insect kind with the same fervor they now limit to the animal kingdom. This part of their history is celebrated and used to paint the Sciame as a cautionary tale of what befalls those who do not adhere to the tenets of Felemelte spirituality.

### Arcana
#### Felemelte Magic
Owed to their close bond with crystals, all Felemelte are possessed with a degree of innate magical talent. Like any skill it must be learned through instruction, practice, or experimentation, but the potential to utilize these abilities is universal to them.

Conjure fire, a small flame that can be produced either in the palm of the hand or at the fingertip, cannot be discharged like a fireball, can be suppressed by sufficient water, wind, earth

Temporarily increasing or decreasing the amount of illumination produced by a crystal shard via touch, including the patches that have grown on their own bodies if they have that trait (eyeglow cannot be adjusted in this fashion)

Conjure water, essentially pulling moisture from the air, only small amounts at a time, enough to fill a glass with a bit of concentration, in a pinch, reduced-to-no effectiveness in dry places, may only produce ice pellets in sufficient cold

Conjure wind, and by wind I mean it's only slightly less impractical than fanning yourself with a hat

Plantmancy, make plants move, -not grow-, move, low-hanging tree branches in your path? give 'em a little extra lift while you pass under, make that stubborn weed uproot itself, get that fruit to wiggle itself off its stem and out of the tree (or bend the stem until it breaks if you're That kind of person)
