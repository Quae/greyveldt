# Tsujana

### Physical Qualities
A unique divergence of Humana from their human ancestry, the Tsujana are a reclusive folk who live almost exclusively deep within the Drusera Thicket. Keen pointed ears and sharp eyes, oft colored a deep red, give them an edge in the undergrowth of the forest, where most believe they make their homes.

### Mental Qualities
They tend to match the range of the usual Humana in intellect, though they are purported to possess an aptitude for the ancient relics and technologies scattered across the world.

### Tsujana Magic
Adapted to life in the Thicket, the inherent magic that They possess is geared largely toward survival. 

Fade, an ability used to blend into the surroundings with an effect similar to camouflage, making Them all the more difficult to spot.

Heal, an ability to speed up metabolism and aid in healing themselves, and helping others to heal through direct physical contact. Though far from miraculous, it can treat minor injuries and sickness, and help to manage more serious conditions.

Where They truly excel however is their ability to enchant. Through special altars and rituals They are able to imbue items with properties beyond the already impressive properties of their craft. Though the possibilities are vast and impressive, enchanted objects are few and far between, and the enchantment must be renewed with time or it will fade.

### Tsujana Cities
It is assumed that They have at least one settlement somewhere within the Drosera Thicket, but thusfar have only been found alone or in small groups. There are some who claim to have found their city, with accounts often varying wildly from one claimant to the next, but no location has ever been confirmed.

### Tsujana Culture
The most striking thing about Them is their lack of a name for Themselves, most commonly referring to Their people simply as "Us". This seems to stem from their almost total isolation from the rest of the world, as They seem almost wholly ignorant of the ways of other cultures. Of the two main exceptions are the Sciame, who They are presumed to routinely interact with in the Thicket, and the more baseline Humana of Beacon whom They refer to as "The Elders".
