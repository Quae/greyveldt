# Sciame
## As consciousness slowly arrived to the inhabitants of the planet, a funny thing nobody really thought about happened-- insects also got a chance at a higher schelon in thoughts. In fact, they were the first. 

Initially, these changes were simply strange and cute, but over time they developed communication-- followed by more specific and complex living spaces (especially in communal species like ants and honeybees). 

Then, *all* the influenced bugs took much, much longer to metamorphose-- and when they did, it came with side effects.

"Their size grew larger, and after the people found them to be far too dangerous, they were rid of and taken to the Drosera Thicket in hopes of eliminating, or at least quarantining, the menace" is what many people say, a myth long told, but the truth is they were always inside the [Thicket](/places/region/drosera_thicket/region.md), and from there they spawned.

 
### Physical Qualities
Sciamii undergo several moltings independent of their genetic lineage from grub to their adult shape, usually a number between 3 to 9 molts before a final metamorphosis. This last step is as crucial as it was before the transition. 
When born, they are the size of a closed fist, and by the time they reach adulthood the tallest height recorded is 1'6 meters, usually staying around 1m-1'2m.

Sciame retain the qualities their heritage marks them with-- Butterfly Sciame have big, colorful  working wings and sensitive antennae, for example, while a Beetle Sciame will have a strong exo-skeleton, strong muscles, and horns to defend themselves with.
However, this is applied to all possible senses. As such, a parasitic Sciame will need to parasitize another (or a specific species) to reproduce, a predatory Sciame will feed off of other prey Sciame (or suitable victims) and so on. Though this can be horrifying for most who observe from the outside-in, most (if not all) Sciame see this as completely natural and unavoidable, if not perfect.

### Mental Qualities
Their development is as average as any other self-conscious being-- they learn as they grow (perhaps a bit quicker, due to their shorter lifespan) and, thanks to their experiences, Sciamii build their personalities. However, it can be said that all Sciame act more erratic and chaotic than "normal", due to a wilder, more "naturalistic" lifestyle. Friendships and comraderie are hard to see outside of social species, usually something only grubs or "weaklings" do (and, even then, it can be short-lived depending on the circumstances)
Naïvete and childishness is something almost all Sciame experience until right before their metamorphosis, with most of them retaining these traits until their very death. This makes communication with them confusing, as they take pleasure when others don't understand their insectile ways. However, at the same time, they dwelve on philosophical and metaphysical topics with great ease, and it's quite common to see even prey and predator discuss such topics, whether they are of how lovely these specific petunias look and how tasty their nectar is or how fortuitous their own evolution has turned out to be (Sometimes, right as the pred feeds off of the prey. Most species outside theirs find this to be quite scary, though for them, again, this is commonplace)

Due to how metamorphosis itself works (Mass to liquid, then back to mass again) their very own way of working can change wildly from the way it was before. Their personality, though mostly the same, can have three drastic possibilities:

- One, it could very well stay the same as it was before, naïve and childish and "cruel"
- Two, they could be "enlightened" during the process-- more mature in the classical sense, they view the world in a different light. They become easier to socialize with, curious with the bigger picture in mind, and become quite adept at survival. Though their ways stay wild and bug-like, they are, indeed, much like you and me.
- Three, they become "corrupted". They become chaotic and manic, their personalities twisted and warped in a way that seems "unnatural". They can flicker between love and hate, pity and mockery, fear and pride-- all within the blink of an eye. Seemingly unable to hold an emotion for more than 5 minutes, there is *always* a logic to their madness that only another Sciame could comprehend-- and even then, it can be hard depending on the individual. Truly, the chaos that nature intended reflects 'pon them like the moon on a clear lake.

Results two and three tend to be more common than result one, however.

### Sciame Society
Sciame don't have a society, per-se. Having wildly different origins at times, including their own dietary and reproductory needs, it may be nearly impossible to hold one single flag for all of them.

However, social species tend to flock together with both their brethren and relative species (For example, moths and butterflies, honeybees and bumblebees, so on and so forth) These groups are known as "Swarms", and how long they last is only defined by how well the included species glue with each other and how well they defend their "nest".  For example, a Swarm could be prepared to defend against Assasin Bug Sciame, or Dragonfly Sciame-- but they may not be ready for a Parasitic Wasp Sciame that can and will decimate their numbers, perhaps even finish the whole Swarm in one go if they're not swift enough (Or if, somehow, a few of them band together, though this is a very rare case)

As such, many Sciame that aren't naturally social tend to regard Swarms as a waste of time and resources, with the added detriment of being easier to spot.
