### Felemelte Magic
Owed to their close bond with crystals, all Felemelte are possessed with a degree of innate magical talent. Like any skill it must be learned through instruction, practice, or experimentation, but the potential to utilize these abilities is universal to them.

Conjure fire, a small flame that can be produced either in the palm of the hand or at the fingertip, cannot be discharged like a fireball, can be suppressed by sufficient water, wind, earth

Temporarily increasing or decreasing the amount of illumination produced by a crystal shard via touch, including the patches that have grown on their own bodies if they have that trait (eyeglow cannot be adjusted in this fashion)

Conjure water, essentially pulling moisture from the air, only small amounts at a time, enough to fill a glass with a bit of concentration, in a pinch, reduced-to-no effectiveness in dry places, may only produce ice pellets in sufficient cold

Conjure wind, and by wind I mean it's only slightly less impractical than fanning yourself with a hat

Plantmancy, make plants move, -not grow-, move, low-hanging tree branches in your path? give 'em a little extra lift while you pass under, make that stubborn weed uproot itself, get that fruit to wiggle itself off its stem and out of the tree (or bend the stem until it breaks if you're That kind of person)

### Felemelte and the Sciame

### Felemelte and Humanity

### On Diets
Primarily vegetables. Meat must be sanctified by a shaman and the list of what is forbidden is a mile long (eggs & fish, for example). The shamanic body pressures constantly for non-vegans to adopt veganism and will falsely blame other diets for completely unrelated problems, but individual preference is still permitted. Hunting is strictly forbidden and all meat is purchased and imported from other nations. Individuals found guilty of poaching or consuming unsanctioned meats are banished to the Lucid Wastes with threat of execution if they are found in Felemelte lands again.

### Treatment of Dead
Bodies of deceased are asset-stripped (necessity only, hides for leather, furs for cold-weather garments, fleece for textiles, etc, NO EATING EVER) and then transported to remote locations, buried, and gravemarked with a polished stone (to prevent accidental dig ups when burying another person in later seasons/years). No personal affects are buried with them, idea is to "give back to nature." In farming communities, dead are buried in fields prior to planting season to provide fertilization and around field perimeters during rest of year.
Dead are honoured in ceremony performed by shaman who recounts lifetime contributions to community and personal achievements
