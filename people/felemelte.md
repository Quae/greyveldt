### Mental Qualities

### Felemelte Magic
Owed to their close bond with crystals, all Felemelte are possessed with a degree of innate magical talent. Like any skill it must be learned through instruction, practice, or experimentation, but the potential to utilize these abilities is universal to them.

Conjure fire, a small flame that can be produced either in the palm of the hand or at the fingertip, cannot be discharged like a fireball, can be suppressed by sufficient water, wind, earth

Temporarily increasing or decreasing the amount of illumination produced by a crystal shard via touch, including the patches that have grown on their own bodies if they have that trait (eyeglow cannot be adjusted in this fashion)

Conjure water, essentially pulling moisture from the air, only small amounts at a time, enough to fill a glass with a bit of concentration, in a pinch, reduced-to-no effectiveness in dry places, may only produce ice pellets in sufficient cold

Conjure wind, and by wind I mean it's only slightly less impractical than fanning yourself with a hat

Plantmancy, make plants move, -not grow-, move, low-hanging tree branches in your path? give 'em a little extra lift while you pass under, make that stubborn weed uproot itself, get that fruit to wiggle itself off its stem and out of the tree (or bend the stem until it breaks if you're That kind of person)

### Felemelte and the Sciame
Where Felemelte scriptures frequently stress their bond and kinship with their unlifted counterparts, on the topic of insects they are glaringly silent. Though it is widely known and acknowledged that in their early days the Sciame lived side by side with the Felemelte in the emerging city of Nest, following the surge in anti-insectoid sentiment of centuries past the animalia the two groups split, with the Sciame being forced to seek refuge far from the light of the Crystal Spire that blessed them with sentience. The precise circumstances of this mass migration have been lost to time, although the Felemelte oral histories paint it as a mutually agreed upon course resulting from dialogues between representatives of the two factions. These histories also heavily imply that the decision was made under threat from a foreign power to invade the city and destroy the Crystal Spire should the Sciame continue to be permitted sanctuary within its borders.

In modern times the Felemelte and Sciame regularly collaborate in a formal capacity, although the former are typically the greater beneficiaries of their joint projects. Insectoids are permitted to reside in the sprawl beyond the Crystal Spire basin of Nest as well as outlying Felemelte settlements, provided they first spend a period of several years living amongst their own to acclimate to the lifting. Their employment opportunities, however, are typically limited to labour-intensive work, often away from the most highly-trafficed areas. Distrust remains high amongst the animalia, and insectoids in Felemelte communities regularly face increased scrutiny.

### Felemelte and Humanity


### On Diets
Primarily vegetables and insects. Meat must be sanctified by a shaman and the list of what is forbidden is a mile long (eggs & fish, for example). The shamanic body pressures constantly for non-vegans to adopt veganism and will falsely blame other diets for completely unrelated problems, but individual preference is still permitted. Hunting is strictly forbidden and all meat is purchased and imported from other nations. Individuals found guilty of poaching or consuming unsanctioned meats are banished to the Lucid Wastes with threat of execution if they are found in Felemelte lands again.
Consumption of insects is particularly encouraged in Nest, both as an alternative to meat and to avoid unplanned liftings. They are typically eaten live or dead, raw or cooked, crushed into dishes, or glazed with syrup or honey.

### Treatment of Dead
Bodies of deceased are asset-stripped (necessity only, hides for leather, furs for cold-weather garments, fleece for textiles, etc, NO EATING EVER) and then transported to remote locations, buried, and gravemarked with a polished stone (to prevent accidental dig ups when burying another person in later seasons/years). No personal affects are buried with them, idea is to "give back to nature." In farming communities, dead are buried in fields prior to planting season to provide fertilization and around field perimeters during rest of year.
Dead are honoured in ceremony performed by shaman who recounts lifetime contributions to community and personal achievements
