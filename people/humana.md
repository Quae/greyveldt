# Humana

### Physical Qualities
Humana identify their ancestry as largely 'human' even though in truth, no one is truly 'human' anymore, thus the alteration to the word itself. Mutation and interbreeding have led to a vast array of minor physiological possibilities. Humana always retain a bipedal form and roughly humanoid features, but the possibilites beyond that are near endless: spots, scales, slitted eyes, third eyelids, gills, webbed fingers, conical nails, even wings... that said, there are no flight capable humana.

Size-wise, humana range from about 4 feet tall to 7 feet, from 90lbs to as large as 500lbs. Exceeding these limitations expells the entity from being considered 'humana', and instead referred to as something else.

### Mental Qualities
Humana are just as versitile in their mental capabilities as they are with their physical.

### Humana Magic
Humana are stunted, magically; the closer one is to 'human', the less innate talent they have. It's estimated that 1 in 10,000 is born with the ability to manipulate matter outside of standard physical interaction, and these individuals are often spirited away for training to prevent accidental disaster, or ostracized in fear.
