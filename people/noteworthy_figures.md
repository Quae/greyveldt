# Noteworthy Figures

Individuals of import both historical and contemporary. Might only be known through story or song with room to doubt as to whether they ever truly existed or be thoroughly documented. Some degree of familiarity with these individual would constitute common knowledge, even if only passing. Arrange by species, timeline, or nation?

## Felemelte
__ADEL__ The first known non-insectoid anthropomorph to encounter humans. Fox. Found in the wilderness beyond Beacon (pre-Sprawl era), unable to communicate in human language. Taken into captivity for study, where she died. Extensive reports of medical examinations and testing (pre and post-mortem) on file in Beacon record storage. Existence was not public knowledge until centuries later when Beacon Council released cherry-picked documents detailing her time in their custody during diplomatic proceedings with Felemelte. Full extent of treatment and experimentation remains sealed and none left alive are presumed to have ever questioned the past Council's interpretation of her life.

__"SPIRIT TALKER" BROKEN ANTLER__ The first Felemelte to develop the magical skillset now associated with shamans. Elk. Gave legitimacy to the "Spire's Whispers" that were considered the work of overactive imaginations until his time. Described as humble, soft-spoken, and awkward. Gained noteriety for his precise weather forecasting following the Early Freeze in his 18th lifted year. Died in his 39th lifted year. Was treated as the template for shamanistic behaviour during the formative days of Felemelte spiritualism. Nickname/title earned from his communing with the Crystal Spire and his insistence that the Spire's Whispers were the words of an entity residing in the Crystal Spire attempting to make contact with the children it had created. Started the Felemelte movement to see all ferals uplifted.

__GRÜNEWALD "THE VENERATED"__ Galapagos Tortoise. Recently-passed head of the shamanic body and, by extension, leader of Nest and the Felemelte people as a whole. Died at 254 lifted years, estimated 277 years since birth. Ascended to leadership of shamanic body following previous leader's death during 88th lifted year. First shaman to hold the post for more than 30 years. Almost universally adored for his public 'kindly, doddering grandfather' persona but known within the shamanic body for his sharp mind, anti-carnivore leanings, and ruthless political and diplomatic maneuvering. Is widely believed to have been the most formidable weathermancer in the world right up to the day of his passing. The first to be interred within the Nest basin since the rise of modern Felemelte spiritualism began.

__NAME TBD__ Grunewald's successor.

__NAME TBD__ Felemelte diplomatic representitive to Beacon Council. Overseer of official Felemelte commercial enterprise in Beacon.

## Hitherlan & the Witchred Mire
__ASTRYD__ The mythic god empress who once ruled Hitherlan, symbolized by three marks of infinity (∞∞∞ or '888' for people who don't know about keyboard alt codes). Legend has it that her reign is cyclical, that she has died and risen many times over. Some say thrice. Some say 'too many times to count'. The latter speculation holds that she has not only nor always ruled over Hitherlan, but rather over many nations - nations of Greyveldt, and nations of the stars. She communes with the dead and the undying. She emerged from Auldeglace, the volcano beside which Hitherlan's imperial palace, Ikuinen. Magis fortify her tomb. Pilgrims congregate octannually in her name.

__LORD REAGANT SMAR__ A changeling child reared by the Unseelie Council to serve as steward of the Hitherlan realm. He, like all stewards before him, is merely a short-term administrative proxy in lieu of God Empress Astryd's divine Return. That being said, all lord reagants of documented history have lived and died in this role. Throughout his reign, he's made great strides to bring the nation into the Emerald Age of Reason, encouraging rationalism, empiricism and scientific thought among the superstitious peasantstock. This being said, Smar diligently upholds a policy of judicial restraint where modernization of the land might interfere with core Hitherlan values, such as environmental protections and the sanctity of animal personhood. This may be attributed to a respectful deference to tradition. Or it could be attributed to a quiet (and not altogether unfounded) fear of the Unseelie Council? 
Who can say?

__JOHANNES__ An ageless talking deer and praetorian guard of the wildfolk of Witchred Mire. He maintains his agelessness by drinking from the Pool of the Immortals. Despite his noble acts of valour, he has enemies in Treelament. Phaedra (dryad) is particularly enamoured with him, though she is not alone in her attentions.

__OUKLUND__ Head of the Treelament, the Parliament of Trees, which governs the wildfolk and unincorporated regions of Witchred Mire. He is Phaedra's "father" in the sense that dryads require a certain tree for the ritual of spawning new dryads...and thereby assumes a paternalistic role in her life, as is the custom of wildfolk treepeeps.

__PHAEDRA__ A dryad, was never a child. Her natural form is unknown to most. Many who wander in to the forest perceive her as a leaf. A select handful of dreamers see a vision of nubile waifish loveliness. It is part of her ethereal nature that the mortal eye beholds in her whatever it wishes to see. Few have seen her as she is.

__PEMERDEEN__ The Archdruid of Hitherlan and Phaedra's godmother. She is the discreet emissary between the Unseelie Council and Treelament. There are many political issues salient to the wildfolk 'kingdoms' within the nation, although the official government under Lord Reagant Smar does not universally recognize their existence or their many plights. Accordingly, as far as Pemerdeen's official Hitherlan-sponsored duties are concerned, she is the senior Hitherlan environmental advisor and the most respected foreign ambassador of the nation.

## Beacon, Roxane & the Academy
__CHASSY__

__RAZOR__

__VALENTIN LUYUS__ Savvy entrepreneur from an elite dynasty that predates Greyveldt's written history. Many legends surround his family's claim to fame and power, but most notably, he's made a fortune for himself and his predecessors as a xuxonite-mogul - providing ice that never melts to a world that didn't know it needed it.

__RUSALKA LUYUS__ Twin sister of wayward misanthrope Valentina Luyus and granddaughter of godmoding moneybags Valentin Luyus (for whom her creepy twin was named).

__VALENTINA LUYUS__ Twin sister of notorious socialite Rusalka Luyus and granddaughter of xuxonite-mogul Valentin Luyus (for whom she was named).

__CALHOUN__ Allegedly spawned from another long prestigious line of...sultans... Though his background is dubious and references hazy, he never hesitates to let his pedigree be known among bourgeoisie and commoners alike. At a young age, he learned two tricks and to this day, he never misses an opportunity to apply them. 1) The world belongs to those who entertain it and 2) find what you want...then take it. 

__HARRIS HUMES__ Celebrated engineer and now-deceased conductor of the historic Beeliner train.
