# Fiorraga Auldres
##  The ancient mountain people of Hitherlan are shapeshifters whose native form appears avian-- many would say 'crowlike' or, at times, 'owlike'.

- FA are mostly hermetic, loners, reclusive except for their birds. They are, by nature, endowed with an empathic/psionic link to birds, including Felemeltian birdfolk. The degree of that link varies by an individual's arcane aptitude, age, practice, etc. These hermits, the solemn ornithologists of Hitherlani culture, maintain a sacred bond between the winged emissaries of the Thereafter and this delicate mortal coil. Their practices are as timeless as the mountain corridors they inhabit.
- As FA age, their bodies weaken, but their passive arcana increases (prophetic visions, deepening empathic connections with living things to an almost telepathic extent, communing with the dead). This is because, as they age, the veil between worlds thins. A Fiorraga Auldre's age-related transition to the Nether is a more gradual, less jarring process than it is for most mortals. Days pass, the candle burns, and one day it burns out.
- FA often reference 'the burning of the candle'. It has yet to be seen whether this is a literal candle each of them guards against the world that marks the beginning and end of their lives, or if it's some astral plane object outside of mundane perception but visible to FAs, or if it's just a metaphor upon which they all got the memo.
- While age brings about a maturation of FA's passive arcana, it also crystalizes form. Shapeshifting becomes a more resistant process. There is some risk for an eldery FA to become trapped in a form they inhabit for very long.
- One might wonder why a shapeshifter need age at all. As a Fiorraga Auldre once explained it, 
 "We each are poured into this world: a cup filled to the brim. Each moment, Death takes a drink. We Fiorraga Auldre cups may change our liquid contents (apple juice to wine) but cannot replenish the quantity. To bear the pitcher of Time is another responsibility altogether."

- By nature the FA are endowed with an empathic/psionic link to birds, including Felemeltian birdfolk. The degree of that link varies by an individual's arcane aptitude, age, practice, etc.
- As shapeshifters, the Fiorraga Auldres can (and have, and do) intermarry with the humans and anyone else they please. Given that many are asexual (for the love of a challenge*), procreation usually serves a purpose. Marriages most commonly occur in the Unseelie Court, to produce successors. Given the limited genepool of FAs, the mating partners are almost exclusively changelings (human or Felemelte raised among the FA) to bring in fresh blood.
- As FA age, their bodies weaken, but their passive arcana increases (prophetic visions, deepening empathic connections with living things to an almost telepathic extent, communing with the dead).
