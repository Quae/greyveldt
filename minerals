##Felemelte Crystals
###<b>Scarcity:</b> Common? <b>Known caches:</b> ???
<i>Felemelte crystals allow the nonsentient life to gain sentience, and lingering exposure also results in other noteworthy (albeit less predictable) physical mutations.</i>

##Xuxonite
###<b>Scarcity:</b> Rare <b>Known caches:</b>
<i>Xuxonite cubes which produce coldness & serve as ice subsitutes where no electrical refrigeration is present. Which is everywhere, as far as we're aware.</i>

##Fioragas Feldspar
###<b>Scarcity:</b> Rare <b>Known caches:</b> Along the coastal Fioragas Mountains of Northern Hitherlan
<i>Feldspar orbs which are used for scrying among Hitherlan's Unseelie Court.</i>
<b>Properties:</b> The milky clouds within Fioragas feldspar's sparkling depths makes it an excellent material for scrying orbs (commonly called 'crystal balls'). It is said that when a skilled medium achieves deep meditation, s/he may see distant worlds by interpretting weird & subtle visuals which appear in the swirling milky clouds of the polished crystal. Orbs are favored for this purpose, but other shapes may be viable scrying medium as well.
