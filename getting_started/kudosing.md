## About the Kudos System

Good roleplay should be rewarded, and who better to 'kudos' good gameplay than the players! 

We track four stats with kudosing:

### Lifetime Kudos Accrual
This is the number of times you've received a kudos from another player! This will NEVER go down, even if you gift or spend kudos!

### Spendable Kudos
Think of this like your coinpurse of kudos that you can spend on something. Every time you're kudosed, every time you reap an in-game reward (such as the '!daily' command), you're awarded a little spending kudos that you'll be able to trade in for server goodies, both IC and OOC! This number will fluctuate.

### Giftable Kudos
We split out 'spendable kudos' and 'giftable kudos' into two seperate currencies since we don't want people to hoard their kudos (and thereby never kudos someone because it would take away from their stash), but we also didn't want restriction-free kudosing that would encourage clique kudosing. Giftable kudos can ONLY be used to kudos other people, but you can only do so much of it, so save your kudosing for _really_ good RP moments. Don't worry, you'll regenerate giftable kudos naturally through gameplay.

You can use '!gj @name' to let someone know that you really appreciated their creativity, good attitude, or great twists in roleplay!

### Unique Kudosees
This tracks the number of unique people you've given kudoses to! We want to encourage interacting with a wide audience of other players, so the higher your unique kudosee count, the better you are for building a great RP community!


## How to Earn Kudos
- Roleplay well. This is the first and foremost way to earn kudos. Create great hooks for other players, have inventive twists to your storylines, engage folks!
- Use '!daily' once a day to collect a small amount of spendable and giftable kudos, just for touching base!
- Write prose and post your artistic endeavors. We'll award kudos for contributing to the Greyveldt community!
- Be helpful. We're watching, and we'll reward you!
