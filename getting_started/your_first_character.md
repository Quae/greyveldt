# Your First Character

### Choose an Ancestry
There's a lot to learn about the Greyveldt multiverse and it's daunting to pick up all at once, so we've chosen to restrict a player's first character to a subset of ancestries that aren't overly complicated:

-[Felemelte](https://github.com/Quae/greyveldt_lore/blob/master/people/felemelte.md)
-[Humana](https://github.com/Quae/greyveldt_lore/edit/master/people/humana.md)

You will 'unlock' the ability to play other ancestries with experience and kudos.
