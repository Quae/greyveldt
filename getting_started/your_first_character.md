# Your First Character

### 1. Choose an Ancestry
There's a lot to learn about the Greyveldt multiverse and it's daunting to pick up all at once, so it's strongly recommended to make your first character with an ancestry that isn't overly complicated:

- [Felemelte](https://github.com/Quae/greyveldt_lore/blob/master/people/felemelte.md)
- [Humana](https://github.com/Quae/greyveldt_lore/edit/master/people/humana.md)

You will 'unlock' the ability to play other ancestries with experience and kudos.

If you want to just look around, you're also welcome to make any Earth-based species of domesticated animal as your first character. It can be of increased intelligence to the point of understanding speech, but it cannot speak in return.

### 2. Stat Up!
Don't panic! [Character stats](https://github.com/Quae/greyveldt_lore/blob/master/getting_started/stats.md) are not end-all defining aspects of a character, but instead guidelines for that character in prose. There are only four stats (fitness, health, intelligence, and charisma), and they're really just to help players boil down to four, poignantly descriptive words or phrases, as well as encourage both strengths and flaws.

### 3. Choose a Starting Zone
As a new player, your starting areas are either the [Beacon Sprawl](places/region/signa/beacon_sprawl.md) in Signa or [The Nest](places/region/hatalmas_vadonban/nest.md) in Hatalmas Vadonban.
