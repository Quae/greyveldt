# Your First Character

### 1. Choose an Ancestry
There's a lot to learn about the Greyveldt multiverse and it's daunting to pick up all at once, so we've chosen to restrict a player's first character to a subset of ancestries that aren't overly complicated:

-[Felemelte](https://github.com/Quae/greyveldt_lore/blob/master/people/felemelte.md)
-[Humana](https://github.com/Quae/greyveldt_lore/edit/master/people/humana.md)

You will 'unlock' the ability to play other ancestries with experience and kudos.

### 2. Stat Up!
Don't panic! [Character stats](https://github.com/Quae/greyveldt_lore/blob/master/getting_started/stats.md) are not end-all defining aspects of a character, but instead guidelines for that character in prose. There are only four stats (fitness, health, intelligence, and charisma), and they're really just to help players boil down to four, poignantly descriptive words or phrases, as well as encourage both strengths and flaws.
