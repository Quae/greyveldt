**Attributes**

***Fitness*** - Affects things like lifting or moving heavy objects, climbing, combat, or, alternatively, speed, evasion, sleight of hand, artistry, penmanship

***Health*** - Affects things like holding one's liquor, one's lunch in gross situations or vertigo, combatting illness or mental affect, soldiering through the pain, etc

***Intelligence*** - Affects things like interfacing with unknown technologies, using foreign weapons, dressing wounds or treating illnesses, deciphering language, etc

***Charisma*** - Affects the inclination of NPCs to respond favorably or give discounts or information. Good RPers will incorporate your charisma score into their response to you, but it is not required.

**Character Development**

A freshly rolled character will choose a +1 and a -1 in the above attributes, coupled with a specialty to explain that value (i.e. Nethali's fitness is +2. Because she works out and has good muscle tone, we might call her specialty as being 'swoll'.)

As character development occurs in game (at a reasonable rate), attributes can change + or - in either direction, but a seasoned character's 'cap' across all four attributes is: +2, +1, 0, -1

These can change at a reasonable rate in accordance with in-prose character development.

**Stat Explanation**

+3 is remarkable/heroic; unlikely to have anyone at +3

+2 is pretty good- the character probably practices or trains.
+1 is skilled average
0 is unskilled average
-1 is worse than average or 'bad at it'
-2 is accidentally burning water bad
-3 is laughably incompetent

There are not end-all defining of every aspect of a character, but instead guidelines for that character in prose.


### Example:
Chassy Khazaran has a fitness +1 with the descriptor 'In Shape', because she's a Sentinel and expected to maintain a minimum level of physical fitness.
Chassy has a +0 in health, so she's just 'Able', as in able-bodied.
Chassy's intelligence is +0, which manifests as 'quiet'.
Her charisma, though, oh man, she's got a -1, described as 'severe'.
