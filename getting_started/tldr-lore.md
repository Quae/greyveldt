### When is Greyveldt?
Ha! Trick question! Greyveldt exists outside of Earth in space and time. Greyveldtians have no knowledge of any politics, world events, history, technology, or anything else we humans have done on this planet with TWO exceptions: 

- Music
- Art

Hand-waving any details that would force lore-adherence by necessity, we wibble-wobble our immersion to allow people to reference music or art. Both of these are largely influential to the creative mind and, since RP is a creative process, we would be remiss in forbidding them. Any time period of art or music is accessible as 'ancient culture'. 

Current characters in Greyveldt would have run across these pieces through Roxane's archival library, through the 'black market' (read: steampunk/magical uTorrent), or learned it orally in the traditional way of our planet's medieval times. 

Note, given that much music includes technology NOT available in Greyveldt, we have handwaived the tech resctrictions for musical instruments exclusively. Players found trying to turn their steampunk electric guitars into handguns will be summarily Bespoken To.

### Where is Greyveldt?
There's a planet somewhere out there in fantasy/sci fi land that's all on its lonesome. Characters will have grown up hearing stories about there being a huge universe out there, with other planets, other creatures, other cultures, and Humana in particular will be inclined to believe themselves to be descended from offworlders.
