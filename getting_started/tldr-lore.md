### When is Greyveldt?
Ha! Trick question! Greyveldt exists outside of Earth in space and time. Greyveldtians have no knowledge of any politics, world events, history, technology, or anything else we humans have done on this planet with TWO exceptions: 

- Music
- Art

Hand-waving any details that would force lore-adherence by necessity, we wibble-wobble our immersion to allow people to reference music or art. Both of these are largely influential to the creative mind and, since RP is a creative process, we would be remiss in forbidding them. Any time period of art or music is accessible as 'ancient culture'. 

Current characters in Greyveldt would have run across these pieces through Roxane's archival library, through the 'black market' (read: steampunk/magical uTorrent), or learned it orally in the traditional way of our planet's medieval times. 

Note, given that much music includes technology NOT available in Greyveldt, we have handwaived the tech resctrictions for musical instruments exclusively. Players found trying to turn their steampunk electric guitars into handguns will be summarily Bespoken To.

### Where is Greyveldt?
There's a planet somewhere out there in fantasy/sci fi land that's all on its lonesome. Characters will have grown up hearing stories about there being a huge universe out there, with other planets, other creatures, other cultures, and Humana in particular will be inclined to believe themselves to be descended from offworlders.

We encourage players to come up with their own backstories and embellishments to their character's stories, culture, upbringing, etc, so when it comes to 'soft' lore like history, your character could believe anything they want, been told anything you want, or reject the status quo vehemently. Just be prepared for the IC consequences.

### What's the tech level?
That's a complicated question.

In terms of what's being currently developed and invented, Greyveldt is in an age where the first steampunk trains are in use, where pocket watches are a novelty for the hugely rich, where printing presses are used by those of means and governments. 

That said, some regions have decidedly futuristic technology. You'll know them when you find them.

Beacon, for example, has security cameras, working toilets, and water purification processes, but these are considered mysterious artifacts from the past, guarded jealously by the magic-wielding technicians. Defer to the region you're in or ask in #halp before including a world-changing technology. 

By and large, though, outside of pockets of tech and steam punk (mostly Beacon and Roxane), the world exists on a medieval/victorian era technology level. When in doubt, go pocket watch and horse-drawn carriage, or ask in #halp.

#### There are no cars, just the one expansive railway train and traditional beasts of burden.

#### No guns. Sorry. Not even pepperboxes. 

### What about magic?

Thanks for asking, yes, there IS magic in Greyveldt! We are a medium to high magic setting, where in there are nymphs, goblins, faeries, curses, healing, talking trees, etc, but the amount of power commanded by PLAYERS is limited. Players are welcome to freely claim the listed magics of their ancestry (such as minor healing, flame or water conjuration, camoflauge). 

#### Be Reasonable
We disapprove of overpowered magics such as flying or transformation without an equivocable cost. When in doubt, ask in #help. We err of the side of 'yes, and', so long as it doesn't restrict other players from enjoying the game and interacting on an equal playing field.

### What about deities?
Yep. They exist, but they're finicky things. 

Only those marked as Colluders are able to take 'godly' action that would directly alter roleplay in a significant way or 'force' things upon players, and Colluders will really only do so when it's beneficial to the RP. 

That's not to say you can't have your garden wilt because you failed to pray to the god of honeybees, that's inconsequential enough that we don't care what you do, but if you decide that your god is gunna strike down your enemies for you, watch out for the Rhino, 'cause he's coming your way.

#### There are ikons, too!
You might want to adopt one or two as your character's patron influencer/saint/demideity. They're great ways to connect your character to the world.  Take a look at our [ikons](https://github.com/Quae/greyveldt/blob/master/culture/ikons/ikons.md) index.
