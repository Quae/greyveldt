## Aidoneus, the duality of death

### Avatar Appearance
Aidoneus is presented as two entities: a black rhinocerous and a bird friend perched upon its back. The bird speaks in a voice alarmingly low for its size, while the rhino is silent. Between the two, they represent the complexity that is death.

### Followers
The followers of Aidoneus are often disciples of either the bird or the rhino. Followers of the bird are often very enthusiastic and take almost anything as a sign, jumping on any breadcrumb for deeper meaning and badly inventing metaphors, whereas followers of the Rhinos are more pragmatic or nihilistic, just....floating along.

#### The Arch of Aidoneus in Beacon's Sprawl
It was unloved. A broken arch standing in testament to some combination of defeat and defiance, in an overgrown field threatening wheat but likely only weeds. Odd as it was for so much to grow in a barren place, what grew withered and yellowed, coming and going as everything must. And in the cracked arch, evidence of having been rammed and bulldozed and beaten was etched into the grey by a horned thing that was not unfriendly, not frightening, only inevitable. It told the Mason, so too this rots.

Followers are either very very enthusiastic and take almost anything as a sign, jumping on any breadcrumb for deeper meaning and badly inventing metaphors, or they're just....floating along.
