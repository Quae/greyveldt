## Elmo, patron saint of salty curmudgeons and angry cats

### Representation / Symbology
St. Elmo was said to have been a wirey, malnourished orange tabby cat with crumpled ears and an angry demeanor. To be touched by St. Elmo is to have a rough, worn, or well-used appearance, needing tended to or repaired. 

### Followers
Followers of St. Elmo are generally referred to as 'eccentric' and 'tempermental'. They are often strange in speech or deed, and usually celebrate their oddities. There are followers of St. Elmo all across Signa, popping up here and there, usually wherever stray cats can be found. 

### Practices
Cats and old people, especially the ones hissing, spitting, growling, and otherwise unfriendly or grumpy, are considered touched by St. Elmo and are to be treated with respect, at a respectful distance, and given food, water, shelter, and things that radiate warmth, be it magic or a place at the hearth unhindered.

### Places of Worship
#### In the Home
Permitting a stray wild cat to partake of one's hearth and home is a token of worship to St. Elmo. More avid followers will arrange their furnishings to better please their guests, or invite kittens to reside in permanence with promise of food, healthcare, and eternal pettings.

#### The Shrine in Beacon's Sprawl
Most of the full garden shrines were within the walls of Beacon itself, the rich gardens and their harvests well protected by the Sentries.

St. Elmo's, however, was established amid the second ring defenses; safe from encroachment via the Lucid Wastes, but easily raided by the commonfolk among the Beacon Sprawl.

It was the least loved of the Sprawl Shrines in public sentiment, its cat-based decor bringing ire for its similarities to felines' feisty Wastes counterparts, and so it frequently found itself vandalised and raided, but never so much as to bring the wrath of the Sentries into the sprawl.

It favored wrought iron and stone in its small octagonal perimeter fencing, just high enough to enclose all but the most athletic of the unenlightened domesticated cats within.

The old, the young, the infirm, roamed the grounds within the protective gates with caution for entrants, scattering at the sight of those unknown.

Most of the shrinetenders - an older population of an age bygone, were tasked with shifting the sand gardens for feline defecation and brushing their wards free of mats.
