## The Sparrow, harbringer of agricultural success and compromise

### Representation / Symbology
The sparrow in flight is the common etched symbology of the sparrow, usually with an oversized locust gripped in its beak. The compromise of the sparrow is in its upkeep; they require certain grain crops in order to subsist and consume the locusts that would, if unchecked, consume all the crops.

#### The Shrine in Beacon's Sprawl
The shrine to the sparrow is, as all the shrines, a place of public rest and potable water, freely accessible to the public so long as they paid their respectful dues to the patron guardian of agriculture. The stone gazebo is open faced on all but three sides- shielding a small alcove for the priest or priestess on duty from the public eye- with the customary bubbling fountain of fresh, drinkable water.

In deference to the sparrow and its skywise neighbors, the shrine itself also has numerous perches carved into the stone: bathing bowls for the local birds and- with sheltered nooks- places from which they could feed. Understandably, the sparrow shrine was placed on the opposite side of town to St. Elmo's. 

Numerous fowl, both domesticated and wild, flitted among the slender white birches and through the shady, tended undergrowth, chosen for its birdly accommodations.
