### Representation / Symbology
The ibis, in particular the scarlet ibis, is a bird so elusive that it borders on the realm of myth. It is said that one who is fortunate enough to possess an ibis can merely share the aura of a person with the bird, by way of a personal possession, and the ibis will take to the skies to find that person, wherever he or she may be. Moreover, the ibis will also deliver a message to that person - making the ibis the preferred method of correspondence with nomadic individuals and ensuring that even fugitives can never outrun the amenities of modern communication. If the birds were any more common, you might imagine they'd be a real nuisance for the sort who don't like to talk or be found...
Due to this unique talent, the ibis has come to represent the 'finding of lost and hidden things' at large, as well as a spirit of surrender to that which is inevitable. Ultimately, like the ibis, death will find us all eventually. The ibis tells us to make our peace with that which we cannot change.
