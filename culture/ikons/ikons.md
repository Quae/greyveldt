### Ikons
#### Religious deifications or symbolic representation of luck, karma, or cosmic interference. Differentiated from deities in that they are more of a thought or a concept, or else considered saints or servants of population subsets (i.e. patron saints of thieves versus the goddess of midnight tresspass)

#### Power Limitations
Think of ikon influence like good luck charms, tarot cards, or mantras. They may or may not work/exist, but most people think they do, and even if they don't, they might offer up a prayer or an offering now and then, just in case. Players are welcome to have their RP turn out one way or another based on how their character pays its respects to ikons, so long as the impact can be written off as 'coincidental' (meeting four 'Toms' in a day and then having a tom cat on your doorstep, ala St. Elmo) rather than 'miraculous' (your pet cat was ressurected and can now talk).

When in doubt, ask in #halp.

#### This is not an exhaustive list
Players are welcome to introduce new ikons in RP. If they take off in popularity, who knows, they might end up 'official' on this list!
